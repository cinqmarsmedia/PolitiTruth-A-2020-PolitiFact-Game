		"ruling_comments": "<p>During last year&rsquo;s campaign for governor we took then-Republican incumbent Bruce Rauner to task for <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/illinois/statements/2018/sep/09/bruce-rauner/rauner-falsely-claims-graduated-income-taxes-alway/\">a False claim</a> about a tax plan being pushed by Democratic rival J.B. Pritzker.</p>\n\n<p>Pritzker said he wanted to replace Illinois&rsquo; flat income tax with graduated rates requiring the wealthy to pay more. Rauner said working families would get soaked because all states with graduated tax systems &mdash; 32 at last count &mdash; impose higher tax rates on middle-income earners than what they currently pay in Illinois. While there are many examples of graduated tax states that impose higher rates on the middle class than does Illinois, there are also several states that charge less.</p>\n\n<p>Now, Pritzker is the state&rsquo;s chief executive &mdash; and the one painting tax policies in overly broad strokes.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2019-illinois-budget-address-governor-j-b-pritzker-speech-text/\">his first budget address</a> late last month, Pritzker, as expected, talked up graduated taxes &mdash; a switch that is politically difficult and would take time to implement because it requires a constitutional amendment.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, he dismissed quicker-to-achieve revenue raising schemes like broadening the sales tax to include services; eliminating a decades-old exemption from the income tax for retirement income; or raising the current flat-rate income tax. Such actions, he argued, would &quot;fall disproportionately on the working poor and the middle class.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Is Pritzker&rsquo;s sweeping assertion on more solid ground than Rauner&rsquo;s? Just barely.</p>\n\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Taxing more services</div>\n\n<p>The sales tax is considered inherently regressive because everyone, rich, poor or in-between, pays the same rate when they make a retail purchase.</p>\n\n<p>But experts told us that extending the tax to cover an array of services, such as landscaping, hair styling and laundry, could not only bring in more revenue but help make the sales tax <a href=\"http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lfb/informational_papers/january_2019/0007_sales_and_use_tax_informational_paper_7.pdf\">less regressive</a> and benefit those with less disposable income by providing a cushion to lower rates overall.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;As income rises, the share of your expenditures that are spent on services generally rises,&quot; said David Merriman, an economist who heads the Fiscal Futures Project at the University of Illinois.</p>\n\n<p>Iowa taxes far more services than Illinois, yet the composite of state and local sales taxes tops out at 7 percent throughout much of our neighboring state and in the largest city, Des Moines, i<a href=\"https://lge.iowa.gov/SalesTaxRate.html\">t&rsquo;s 6 percent</a>. In Wisconsin, which also taxes more services than Illinois, the sales tax tops out at <a href=\"https://www.revenue.wi.gov/Pages/FAQS/pcs-taxrates.aspx#txrate2\">5.6 percent</a> in Milwaukee. In Chicago, the combined tax rate currently sits at 10.25 percent.</p>\n\n<p>If Illinois taxed the same array of services as neighboring Iowa, it could boost annual revenue by $1.2 billion,<a href=\"http://cgfa.ilga.gov/Upload/ServiceTaxes2017update.pdf\"> according to projections</a> from the Illinois legislature&rsquo;s bipartisan fiscal forecaster. Following a more modest Wisconsin model would raise an extra $588 million, the forecaster said.</p>\n\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Taxing retirement income</div>\n\n<p>Most states tax income, but Illinois is <a href=\"http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lfb/informational_papers/january_2019/0004_individual_income_tax_provisions_in_the_states_informational_paper_4.pdf\">one of</a> <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/documents/fiscal/StateTaxOnPensions2015update.pdf\">the few</a> that exempts all forms of retirement income &mdash; including Social Security, pensions and withdrawals from 401(k) and IRA retirement savings plans. The Illinois comptroller&rsquo;s office estimated the tax break cost the state <a href=\"https://illinoiscomptroller.gov/financial-data/find-a-report/tax-expenditure-report/fiscal-year-2015/\">$2.3 billion</a> in revenue in 2014&nbsp;when the income tax rate was close to the current 4.95 percent.</p>\n\n<p>The retirement exemption dates back to 1972 <a href=\"https://www.illinoistax.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/17_December2009TaxFacts.pdf\">amid concerns</a> of high poverty rates among seniors. Today, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-age/?activeTab=graph&amp;currentTimeframe=0&amp;startTimeframe=9&amp;selectedDistributions=65&amp;selectedRows=%7B%22wrapups%22:%7B%22united-states%22:%7B%7D%7D,%22states%22:%7B%22illinois%22:%7B%7D%7D%7D&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D\">less than 10 percent</a> of seniors live in poverty.</p>\n\n<p>Pritzker would be correct about harming the poor and middle class if Illinois simply did away with the retirement income break in its entirety. But that&rsquo;s not how it&rsquo;s done by most states.</p>\n\n<p>In general, states that tax retirement income nonetheless shield some of it from taxation. That&rsquo;s the case in neighboring <a href=\"https://www.in.gov/dor/5863.htm#socialsecurity\">Indiana</a> and <a href=\"https://www.michigan.gov/taxes/0,4676,7-238-43513-397990--,00.html#7\">Michigan</a>, which, like Illinois, have flat-rate income taxes. Both states exempt Social Security income, and Michigan also allows thousands of dollars in deductions on pension and annuity benefits.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You can do it in a way that&rsquo;s not the least bit regressive,&quot; said Carol Portman, president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers&rsquo; Federation of Illinois.</p>\n\n<p>The Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, a liberal-leaning Chicago-based fiscal watchdog, <a href=\"https://www.ctbaonline.org/reports/it-all-about-revenue-common-sense-solution-illinois%E2%80%99-fiscal-solvency\">has proposed</a> taxing retirement income but suggests leaving the exemption in place for taxpayers with an adjusted gross income below $50,000. Doing so could still net the state more than $1 billion in additional annual revenue, data from the Illinois Department of Revenue indicate.</p>\n\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Raising the income tax</div>\n\n<p>In his budget speech, Pritzker held out his graduated tax push as the only way to inject more fairness into a tax system currently charging everyone at the same flat rate. But during last year&rsquo;s primary campaign, Pritzker himself floated a revenue-raising plan to make the single-rate system more progressive that would require legislative approval but no constitutional change.</p>\n\n<p>In essence, it would have hiked the current 4.95 percent flat rate tax but then softened the blow for those of modest means with increased or new exemptions and credits as a temporary measure while Pritzker pushed for a formal graduated tax.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We can do what other states have done with a flat income tax and that is to put exemptions in place, to raise the overall rate but protect the middle class and those striving to get there with those exemptions,&quot; Pritzker said at <a href=\"https://news.wttw.com/2018/02/19/2018-governor-s-race-democratic-candidates-face-high-school-students\">a candidate forum</a> in February of 2018.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s less than clear what that would look like for Illinois. But Merriman, the University of Illinois economist, said he thinks the state could explore it &mdash; especially since Illinois already offers an earned-income tax credit to low-income taxpayers.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;That option is very much under-discussed, in my view, as a possibility,&quot; Merriman said.</p>\n\n<p>Still, the governor&rsquo;s office maintains Pritzker&rsquo;s graduated-tax plan is the only way forward.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The governor proposed a realistic plan to serve as a bridge to the future, with the ultimate goal of a fair tax system that will transform state finances in a momentous way without burdening the middle class,&quot; spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh wrote in an email. &quot;The alternative to this plan is doing more of the same: namely, raising taxes on the middle class.&quot;</p>\n\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\n\n<p>Pritzker said that raising revenue for cash-strapped Illinois by taxing more services, taxing retirement income and increasing the state&rsquo;s current flat-rate income tax would &quot;fall disproportionately on the working poor and the middle class.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Those are indeed possibilities, but examples from some other states show they don&rsquo;t have to be realities.</p>\n\n<p>There are states with broader, less regressive sales taxes. There are flat tax states that tax retirement income without burdening the poor and middle class. And, as Pritzker himself once pointed out, there may even be ways to wring more revenue from a flat tax system without harming taxpayers of more modest means.</p>\n\n<p>We rate his claim Mostly False.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p><em><strong>MOSTLY FALSE</strong> &ndash; The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Click here <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i/#Truth-O-Meter%20ratings\">for more</a> on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</em></p>",

But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it &quot;allows&quot; immigrants in the country illegally to also register or participate in the election process.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The law has not changed: only U.S. citizens who meet other eligibility requirements such as age can register to vote. Possessing a CityKey does not change that,&quot; said Janece Ortiz, director of Chicago CityKey, within the city clerk&rsquo;s office. &quot;To be perfectly clear, this office would never encourage any person who is ineligible to vote to do so.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Federal law prohibits non-U.S. citizens from voting for candidates seeking federal offices, such as the presidency or a seat in Congress.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2017/sep/15/adam-putnam/san-francisco-takoma-park-noncitizens-elections/\">A few municipalities</a> across the country let non-U.S. citizens vote in local elections if it&rsquo;s allowed by a state constitution, statute or local ordinance. (Non-U.S. citizens includes immigrants with lawful permanent residence and immigrants here illegally.)</p>\n\n<p>But Chicago is not one of these cities. Non-U.S. citizens <a href=\"https://app.chicagoelections.com/documents/general/Statement-Regarding-Voter-Registration-IDs.pdf\">cannot vote</a> for city offices or state offices, said Jim Allen, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Elections.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of their immigration status, parents in Chicago can vote for <a href=\"https://cps.edu/SiteCollectionDocuments/TraditionalLSCElectionGuide_English.pdf\">Local School Councils</a> at the school level, Allen said. <a href=\"https://cps.edu/lscrelations/Pages/LSC_aboutlscs.aspx\">Traditional Local School Councils</a> include the principal, parents, community representatives, teachers, a non-teacher representative and a student representative. (Chicago Board of Education members are appointed by the mayor.)</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Local School Council elections are nothing like standard elections,&quot; Allen said. &quot;LSC elections do not involve voter registration, they are not governed by the Election Code, and they are not managed by election authorities.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The Facebook post claiming that Chicago&rsquo;s ID card &quot;allows&quot; immigrants in the country illegally to vote in local, state, and federal elections is not based in facts.

		"ruling_comments": "<p>The General Assembly recently took strides to change how Virginia draws its political maps, despite opposition from most black delegates.</p>\n\n<p>It passed a proposed constitutional amendment that would create a commission of citizens and lawmakers to draw congressional and state legislative districts. The process has long been in the sole hands of the legislature, leading to charges of gerrymandering.</p>\n\n<p>Although the resolution unanimously passed the Senate and cleared the House on an 83-15 vote, 11 of 14 black delegates voted against it. Several said the proposed amendment - which must approved by the legislature again next before it&rsquo;s put to voters - offers no guarantee of black representation on the redistricting commission. They also complained that black legislators weren&rsquo;t included in negotiations between the House and Senate that ironed out the final version of the redistricting resolution.</p>\n\n<p>That brought Del. Chris Jones, R-Suffolk, to his feet. Jones, who is white, has been a &nbsp;delegate for 21 years. He urged passage of the resolution and said Republicans, during two decades of controlling the House, have a strong record empowering black delegates.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Republicans have had more African-Americans on key committees than when the Democrats were in control,&quot; he said.</p>\n\n<p>We wondered if Jones is right.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jones told us the &quot;key committees&quot; he was referring to are the budget-writing House Appropriations Committee, and the Commerce and Labor Committee, which controls business regulations. The House has an informal rule that no member can serve on both. Jones is chairman of the Appropriations Committee.</p>\n\n<p>We also spoke Del. Lamont Bagley, D-Richmond, chairman of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus. He agreed with Jones&rsquo; definition of &quot;key committees.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The last time Democrats controlled the 100-seat House was 1997, when there were 52 Democrats, 47 Republicans and one independent. This year, Republicans have 51 seats; Democrats, 49.</p>\n\n<p>The party in power chooses the speaker, who controls all committee assignments. Delegates lobby to serve on prestigious panels and committee chairmen often urge the speaker to assign certain lawmakers to their groups. The final decision, however, rests with the speaker.</p>\n\n<p>In 1997, the speaker was Tom Moss, a Democrat from Norfolk. This year, it&rsquo;s Kirk Cox, a Republican from Colonial Heights.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that the number of black delegates has increased. In 1997, there were 10; now there&rsquo;s 14. If strict proportionality was a House rule (which it&rsquo;s not), then blacks would have occupied 10 percent of each committee&rsquo;s seats in 1997, and 14 percent this year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Numbers</strong></p>\n\n<p>In 1997, three black lawmakers served on the 22-member Appropriations Committee, which was roughly proportional to their House membership. This year, six black members &nbsp;are on the panel - double their proportion in the House.</p>\n\n<p>In 1997, two black legislators served on the Corporations, Insurance and Banking Committee - which became the Commerce and Labor Committee. This year, four are on the panel. That&rsquo;s one more than they would have under proportionality.</p>\n\n<p>A side note: In 1997, Democrats didn&rsquo;t have today&rsquo;s informal rule that no one serves on both Appropriations and Commerce and Labor. One black legislator - the late William Robinson Jr., D-Norfolk - served on both panels. In other words, only four of 10 black delegates had seats on a key committees.</p>\n\n<p>This year, 10 of 14 black delegates sit on a key committee.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other House committees</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here are the minority breakdowns of the other House committees in existence since at least 1997, although they do not influence this fact-check. We list the year, the number of blacks on the panel, and the number of seats on the committee.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>&bull;Agriculture: 1997, 1 of 22; 2019, 2 of 22</li>\n\t<li>&bull;Cities, Counties &amp; Towns, 3 of 22; 2 of 22</li>\n\t<li>&bull;Courts of Justice: 3 of 21; 3 of 18</li>\n\t<li>&bull;Education: 2 of 22; 3 of 22</li>\n\t<li>&bull;Finance: 2 of 22; 2 of 22.</li>\n\t<li>&bull;General Laws: 2 of 21; 5 of 22</li>\n\t<li>&bull;Health, Welfare &amp; Institutions: 3 of 22; 4 of 22</li>\n\t<li>&bull;Militia &amp; Police: 6 of 22; 2 of 22</li>\n\t<li>&bull;Privileges &amp; Elections: 2 of 21; 2 of 22.</li>\n\t<li>&bull;Rules: 0 of 9; 3 of 17.</li>\n\t<li>&bull;Transportation: 3 of 21; 4 of 22.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We asked Bagby, chairman of the Black Caucus, if he had concerns about minority committee appointments in the House. &quot;No arguments there,&quot; he said.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Senate</strong></p>\n\n<p>We wanted to give you the state Senate numbers, although they, too, don&rsquo;t count in this fact-check.</p>\n\n<p>Partisan control of the chamber, unlike the House, has fluctuated this century. The last time Democrats controlled the 40-member Senate was 2011. There were five black senators then, the same number as today.</p>\n\n<p>In the budget-writing Finance Committee, minority members fell from 3 of 15 in 2011 to 2 of 16 this year. &nbsp;The 15-member Senate Commerce and Labor Committee rose from two blacks in 2011 to three this year.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the other Senate committee breakdowns:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>&bull;Agriculture: 1 of 15 in 2011; 2 of 15 in 2019</li>\n\t<li>&bull;Courts of Justice: 3 of 15; 1 of 15</li>\n\t<li>&bull;Education &amp; Health: 2 of 15; 2 of 15</li>\n\t<li>&bull;General Laws &amp; Technology: 1 of 15; 1 of 15</li>\n\t<li>&bull;Local Government: 3 of 15; 1 of 13</li>\n\t<li>&bull;Privileges &amp; Elections: 1 of 15; 2 of 15</li>\n\t<li>&bull;Rehabilitation &amp; Social Services: 2 of 15; 2 of 14</li>\n\t<li>&bull;Rules: 4 of 17; 1 of 15</li>\n\t<li>&bull;Transportation: 2 of 15; 1 of 13.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Our ruling </strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Jones said, &nbsp;&quot;Republicans have had more African-Americans on key committees than when the Democrats were in control.&quot; He later said he was referring to the House &nbsp;Appropriations Committee and the Commerce and Labor Committee - a delineation that the chairman of the Black Caucus agrees with.</p>\n\n<p>There were three black members of Appropriations in 1997 - the last time Democrats controlled the House. Now there are six. There were two black legislators serving on the committee that became Commerce and Labor; now there&rsquo;s four.</p>\n\n<p>We need to consider that the number of black delegates in the 100-member House rose from 10 in 1997 to 14 today. In other words, while black representation in the House rose by 40 percent during that span, it increased by 100 percent on Appropriations and 50 percent on Commerce &amp; Labor.</p>\n\n<p>So Jones&rsquo; claim holds up. We rate it True.</p>\n\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>",

Walker says Evers would raise taxes to do all he is pledging to do. Evers, in a telephone interview, responded by saying: &quot;He is a liar. .&thinsp;.&thinsp;. I&rsquo;m planning to raise no taxes.&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p>Evers spokesman Sam Lau said afterward that Evers&#39; quote in the Post was a reference to a plan to cut income taxes for the middle class and scale back a tax break for farmers and manufacturers, though the story did not reference any such context.</p>\n\n<p>Three days later, Evers made a nearly identical pledge in an interview on WISN-TV&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wisn.com/article/upfront-recap-walker-evers-make-closing-arguments-in-governors-race/24642394\">UpFront with Mike Gousha</a>. Gousha asked about Walker&rsquo;s claim that Evers would have to raise taxes to fund his promises.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m planning on raising no taxes,&quot; Evers said. &quot;The idea that somehow he&rsquo;s put me in this position of saying I&rsquo;m going to tax, that&rsquo;s just crazy. I&rsquo;ve never said that.

Obviously one of them&rsquo;s the gas tax, but the reason the budget is the way it is is that we listened to the people of Wisconsin,&quot; Evers told reporters in Appleton. &quot;They said they wanted better schools, more adequately resourced schools. They said they wanted health care, and affordable and accessible health care. And they said they wanted to fix the roads. So those issues, basically there&rsquo;s a cost involved in that.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Three days later, Evers doubled down on the need for tax increases, saying a funding increase for the University of Wisconsin and major interstate improvements likely wouldn&rsquo;t happen without the tax increases Republicans oppose.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We have to have revenue,&quot; Evers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/04/tony-evers-funding-uw-interstate-projects-tied-tax-increases/3055494002/\">said</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Asked about the reversal, Evers&rsquo; staff didn&rsquo;t dispute the change but defended the rationale and results.<br>\n<br>\n&quot;Under the governor&rsquo;s proposal, the median family of four will save more than $1,000 on their income taxes this biennium,&quot; Melissa Baldauff, Evers&rsquo; deputy chief of staff, said in an email. &quot;To help fund this needed tax relief for the middle-class, the governor limits tax provisions that benefit a narrow sliver of taxpayers to bring them more closely in line with other claimants.&quot;</p>\n\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\"><strong>Our rating</strong></div>\n\n<p>With the election bearing down in November, Evers told Wisconsinites he wouldn&rsquo;t raise taxes.</p>\n\n<p>Now his first budget as governor includes proposals that would raise taxes by more than $1 billion.</p>\n\n<p>He offered an explanation for the increases and in one case is seeking to negate an increase with other changes.

(Read more about our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\">partnership with Facebook</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>Etta Place was the girlfriend of the Sundance Kid, n&eacute;&nbsp;Harry Alonzo Longabaugh. In the 1969 movie&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064115/\">&quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,&quot;</a> Longabaugh was played by Robert Redford and Place was played by Katharine Ross.</p>\n\n<p>But a <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/6-things-you-might-not-know-about-butch-cassidy\">photo</a> of the real-life pair does not resemble the Facebook post. Sundance, by historical accounts, had white skin. The picture posted on Facebook is not Longabaugh and Place.</p>\n\n<p>Some history: Longabaugh got his nickname after stealing a horse near Sundance, Wyo., in 1887. He met Place in the mid 1890s and the duo dovetailed with Butch Cassidy after taking up in a tent at Robbers Roost, an outlaw hideout in southeastern Utah,&nbsp;according to History.com.</p>\n\n<p>Longabaugh was supposedly the best shot and fastest gunslinger in the Wild Bunch, a group of &quot;robbers and rustlers who ranged through the Rocky Mountains and plateau desert regions of the West in the 1880s and &lsquo;90s,&quot; a post on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sundance-Kid\">Britannica</a>&nbsp;says.</p>\n\n<p>In the introduction to a 2009 <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sundance-Kid-Harry-Alonzo-Longabaugh/dp/0806141158\">book</a> about Longabaugh, one of his descendants, Paul Ernst, writes that an ancestor of the outlaw emigrated from Germany to the Colonies in the 1770s. (PolitiFact wrote the publisher of the book in hopes of reaching Ernst or his wife, Donna Ernst, who wrote the biography, but we did not immediately receive a response.)</p>\n\n<p>We couldn&rsquo;t find the origins of the photo on Facebook. A Reddit <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/96st6p/couple_circa_late_1800s/\">post</a> from last year describes the image as a couple in the late 1800s. In 2015, a Twitter account named Black History Heroes <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/96st6p/couple_circa_late_1800s/\">calls it</a> a &quot;vintage tintype photograph of African American couple, circa late 1800s.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>In the 19th century, <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/black-culture/explore/10-black-history-little-known-facts/\">according to PBS</a>, &quot;the Wild West drew enslaved blacks with the hope of freedom and wages.&quot; African-Americans made up at least a quarter of cowboys, the broadcasting system said in a post about black history facts, and it&rsquo;s believed that the real &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; was inspired by a black man named Bass Reeves.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, we can&rsquo;t tell someone&rsquo;s race from a photo. But two photos <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sundance-Kid/media/573773/116219\">here</a> of Longabaugh, including one from the Library of Congress, do not look like the image that appeared on Facebook. <a href=\"http://noblebandits.asu.edu/Bio/CassidySundance.html\">Neither</a> does this one.</p>\n\n<p>When we asked John Barton, a history lecturer at Utah State University, about the Facebook post he said: &quot;good picture, but not Sundance and Etta.&quot; He shared several photos of the actual couple, including one taken in New York before they went to South America with Butch Cassidy.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;He was not black,&quot; Barton said. &quot;The Sundance Kid,&quot; by Donna Ernst, &quot;is quite clear on his early years. There was a black outlaw named Isom Dart that rode with Butch and Sundance from time to time. That might be the confusion.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>We rate the Facebook post False.</p>\n\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\n\n<div class=\"artembed\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"artembed\"><em>Correction&nbsp;March 6, 2019: A 2009 book on Harry Longabaugh says that an ancestor of&nbsp;his emigrated from Germany in the 1770s, but does not say it was his father.</em></div>",

(Read more about <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536?helpref=related\">our partnership with Facebook</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>The Minneapolis area is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, hub for Somali-Americans in the country, and many of them&nbsp;came as refugees. Omar herself came to the United States as a refugee in 1995.</p>\n\n<p>However,&nbsp;the post is wrong on multiple levels.</p>\n\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Did Obama settle 43,000 Somali refugees in Minnesota?</div>\n\n<p>For refugee resettlement figures on Obama&rsquo;s watch, we turned to an interactive website from the <a href=\"http://ireports.wrapsnet.org/\">Refugee Processing Center</a> that provides data going back to 2002.</p>\n\n<p>As it turns out, 6,320 refugees from Somalia were resettled in Minnesota between 2009 and 2017, when Obama served as president. That&rsquo;s about one-seventh of the amount claimed in the meme.</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s fewer than the number settled in Minnesota during the final seven years of the George W. Bush presidency. From 2002 to 2008, the government resettled 9,858 Somalis in Minnesota.</p>\n\n<p>During the Obama years, 54,514 Somali refugees were resettled nationally, meaning that Minnesota accounted for about 11.5 percent of the national total.</p>\n\n<p>During the Bush years, the national total was 46,439, making Minnesota&rsquo;s share higher under Bush than it was under Obama, at 21.2 percent.</p>\n\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Are there &lsquo;around 80,000&rsquo; refugees in Minnesota?</div>\n\n<p>There aren&rsquo;t even 80,000 Somalis living in Minnesota -- much less 80,000 Somali refugees living there, <a href=\"https://www.sctimes.com/story/news/local/2018/12/17/st-cloud-somali-population-minnesota-statistics/2304695002/\">according to the U.S. Census Bureau</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The bureau&rsquo;s five-year estimate found between 42,400 and 55,200 Somalis living in Minnesota, in 13,000 to 16,500 households.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Numbers vary, largely because of census undercounts and secondary migration that might not document people properly,&quot; said Stefanie Chambers, a Trinity College political scientist who has studied the Somali-American community in the United States.</p>\n\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Did Omar win because of Somali-American votes?</div>\n\n<p>Omar <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Minnesota%27s_5th_Congressional_District_election,_2018\">won the Democratic nomination</a> with 65,237 votes, which was 24,081 votes ahead of her closest competitor. (In such a strongly Democratic district, the Republican nominee ended up losing to Omar, 78 percent to 22 percent.)</p>\n\n<p>So was the Somali-American electorate in the district the main reason she won the all-important primary? We don&rsquo;t have exact figures, but we were able to reverse-engineer some answers.</p>\n\n<p>According to the refugee resettlement data, we found that the major jurisdictions of the 5th district -- mainly Minneapolis, but a few others as well -- received roughly half of the Somali refugees who were resettled in the state under both Bush and Obama.</p>\n\n<p>If we use the high end of the Census Bureau&rsquo;s statewide estimate for Somali Americans in Minnesota -- 55,200 -- then this means the 5th district was probably home to about 27,600 Somali Americans.</p>\n\n<p>So, Omar won more than 65,000 primary votes in a district that likely had about 27,600 Somali-Americans. This means she had to have won tens of thousands of votes from non-Somalis.</p>\n\n<p>And even this probably overstates the impact of Somali-American voters.</p>\n\n<p>Not all of the 27,600 Somalis in the district are able to vote, since Minnesota&rsquo;s Somali population skews young.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, even those who were eligible to vote may not have turned out at the polls. The district as a whole saw only 18.8 percent of the population turn out to vote in the primary. If the district&rsquo;s Somali population turned out at that rate, no more than about 5,000 Somali voters would have cast a primary ballot.</p>\n\n<p>And 5,000 votes would have been less than one-tenth of Omar&rsquo;s primary vote total, and only about one-fifth of her margin of victory.</p>\n\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Was her victory &lsquo;planned&rsquo;?</div>\n\n<p>The idea that Omar&rsquo;s victory was preordained by demographics is ridiculous.</p>\n\n<p>No one forced the voters of the 5th congressional district of Minnesota to vote for Omar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As we&rsquo;ve shown, the pattern of Somali settlement in Minnesota long predated Obama&rsquo;s tenure in the White House. So the viral image has no grounds for singling out Obama.</p>\n\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\n\n<p>The viral image said, &quot;Obama settled 43,000 Somalian refugees in Minnesota. As of 2016, there were around 80,000. No wonder Ilhan Omar was elected. It was planned.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The meme significantly overstates the number of Somali refugees settled under Obama in Minnesota, the total number of Somali refugees in the state, and the impact that Somali voters could have had on the primary election results, much less the lopsided general election. In no way can Omar&rsquo;s victory have been &quot;planned,&quot; by Obama or anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>We rate the statement Pants on Fire.</p>\n\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>",

We know what this last tax law did &mdash;&nbsp;70 percent of the benefits went to the wealthiest 1 percent.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>He made virtually the same statistical claim in at least two <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1902/17/sotu.01.html\">other</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqBoeQkyvoo\">interviews</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s partially right.</p>\n\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Law does benefit wealthier taxpayers more</div>\n\n<p>When PolitiFact <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/dec/19/who-wins-and-who-loses-tax-bill/\">evaluated</a> the bill just before Trump signed it, we found that every income group would pay less in taxes in 2019, but that the benefits would flow disproportionately to wealthier taxpayers.</p>\n\n<p>And by 2027, every income group below $75,000 would see a tax increase, while only those income ranges above $75,000 would still see a cut.</p>\n\n<p>The primary reason for that is some of the individual tax cuts phase out after 2025, because of congressional rules. By allowing some tax cuts to expire, the Republicans needed only 50 votes instead of 60 votes to change tax law. In this case, the tax changes that benefit lower-income people expire, while the measures that largely affect higher incomes do not.</p>\n\n<p>So-called reconciliation has been done <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/25/harry-reid/reid-says-repblicans-have-used-reconciliation-more/\">numerous times</a> in the past, by Democrats and Republicans, when their majorities in the Senate were strong enough only to meet the 50-vote threshold.</p>\n\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">But 80% figure is only point in time</div>\n\n<p>Brown actually understated his claim, according to his Senate office. The office, citing a Vox <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/18/16791174/republican-tax-bill-congress-conference-tax-policy-center\">news article</a>, told us the senator should have said that 80 percent, not 70 percent, of the benefits of the tax law went to the wealthiest 1 percent.</p>\n\n<p>That article even went a bit further, saying nearly 83 percent of the law&rsquo;s benefit would go to the top 1 percent.</p>\n\n<p>But that figure represents only one point in time for a law that spans 10 years.</p>\n\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Similar claim</div>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve already rated as <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/10/tax-march/nevada-tv-ad-cherry-picks-tax-cut-benefits-top-1/\">Half True</a> a claim that 83 percent of the tax breaks go to the wealthiest 1 percent. That claim, like the Vox article, relied on <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/distributional-analysis-conference-agreement-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act\">an analysis</a> that the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, did for three years.</p>\n\n<p>In two of the years studied, 1 percenters &nbsp;&mdash; in 2018, those with income of more than $733,000 per year &nbsp;&mdash; got an estimated 20.5 percent of the tax law&rsquo;s benefits in 2018 and will get 25.3 percent of the benefits in 2025, according to the &nbsp;analysis.</p>\n\n<p>Only in 2027 would an estimated 82.8 percent of the tax cuts go to the top 1 percent of tax filers.</p>\n\n<p>Again, the shift occurs because most of the individual tax cuts end after 2025. That leaves corporate tax cuts, which do more to help upper income earners.</p>\n\n<p>(Our friends at the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/14/does-trump-tax-cut-give-percent-benefits-top-one-percent/?utm_term=.4af94efad93a\">Fact Checker</a> and <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2018/01/democrats-misleading-tax-line/\">FactCheck.org</a> also rated 83 percent claims and came up with conclusions similar to our Half True.)</p>\n\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Another analysis</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://lsa.umich.edu/econ/people/faculty/jrhines.html\">James Hines Jr.</a>, a University of Michigan professor of economics, told us that the Tax Policy Center is well respected for such estimates, but he also pointed to <a href=\"https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?id=5054&amp;func=startdown\">estimates</a> done by Congress&rsquo; nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019, according to the committee, the top 1 percent get an estimated 23.4 percent of the tax law&rsquo;s benefits &mdash; similar to the Tax Policy Center&rsquo;s estimate of the early impact of the tax law.</p>\n\n<p>By 2027, the 1 percent would actually get more than 100 percent of the tax law&rsquo;s benefits, by the committee&rsquo;s calculation.</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s because the joint committee included in its analysis the impact of the tax law effectively <a href=\"https://www.tennessean.com/story/money/2018/01/10/individual-mandate-repealed-three-things-expect/988260001/\">repealing</a> the Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s individual mandate in 2019. The repeal means lower- and middle-income taxpayers lose tax credits they would have received by buying health insurance on the health law&rsquo;s exchanges, the Tax Policy Center&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/author/joseph-rosenberg\">Joseph Rosenberg</a> told us.</p>\n\n<p>A final note:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/staff/adam-michel\">Adam Michel</a>, a tax policy and federal budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told us that the two sets of estimates appear accurate for what they measure, but that it only makes sense that people with larger incomes would get larger tax cuts in terms of total dollars.</p>\n\n<p>But Michel said that many lower-income people get more than a 15 percent cut in their taxes paid, while wealthier people may only get an 8 percent cut in their taxes.</p>\n\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\n\n<p>Brown says that with the Trump tax law, &quot;70 percent of the benefits went to the wealthiest 1 percent.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>One nonpartisan analysis estimates that in 2027, the top 1 percent will receive 83 percent of the benefits of the law that Trump signed. And another analysis puts that figure even higher for 2027.</p>\n\n<p>But both analyses estimate that through 2025, the 1 percent gets about 20 percent to 25 percent of the tax cuts.</p>\n\n<p>Brown&rsquo;s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important information. We rate it Half True.</p>\n\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>",

But according to pundit and former Hillary Clinton campaign staffer Zerlina Maxwell, Sanders&rsquo; speech announcing his 2020 bid didn&rsquo;t do much to shore up his support.</p>\n\n<p>Maxwell, speaking on MSNBC following Sanders&rsquo; remarks, said the senator had buried any mention of race and gender until deep into his 2020 presidential kickoff speech.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I clocked it. He did not mention race or gender until 23 minutes into this speech,&quot; Maxwell said March 2. &quot;As somebody who is a black woman ... I was looking to hear messaging specifically for my community, and I did not, at least until 23 minutes into the speech. &quot;</p>\n\n<p>Later, she delivered the same message to her more than 150,000 Twitter followers &mdash; in a tweet that has since been deleted.<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/l-QfFrylx2Z8x7GN9gUcHTN7sy3KWUI6RgMIeXrbshRWlxu-eZBWG4eq-kLi7d-1C2-yDFVKMdiOr2ZVpheF6p9_spGsKcUGlKsPsUEIN6KiuYzg6k12nEUhUjDH7NGRKG8g-gZn\"></p>\n\n<p>But a review of the tape shows Sanders made mention of these constituencies earlier in his speech, a reference Maxwell now says she accidentally overlooked.</p>\n\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Sanders&rsquo; kickoff speech</div>\n\n<p>Sanders staged his first 2020 campaign rally in Brooklyn, several miles from his birthplace. In opening remarks, he thanked his family and acknowledged several key supporters.</p>\n\n<p>Within the first five minutes of his speech, Sanders proposed a re-ordering of America&rsquo;s governing principles, and made specific reference to race and gender (emphasis added):</p>\n\n<p>&quot;At our very first rally, I want to welcome you to a campaign, which says loudly and clearly that the underlying principles of our government will not be greed, hatred and lies. It will not be <strong>racism, sexism</strong>, xenophobia, homophobia and religious bigotry. It will not be tax breaks for billionaires and efforts to throw millions off the health care that they currently have.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;This campaign is going to end all of that. The principles of our government will be based on justice. On economic justice, on social justice, on <strong>racial justice</strong>, on environmental justice.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Sanders referenced race and gender again around 21 minutes into his speech. Sanders pledged a campaign to unify the country, he said, in contrast to President Donald Trump, who &quot;wants to divide us up based on the color of our skin, based on where we were born, based on our gender, based on our religion or our sexual orientation.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>MSNBC aired the roughly 37-minute speech in its entirety. Afterwards, host Alex Witt turned to the panel for their reaction, at which point Maxwell claimed Sanders had been mute about race and gender until 23 minutes in.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And just for point of comparison, I went back and looked at Elizabeth Warren&rsquo;s opening speech,&quot; Maxwell said. &quot;She mentions race and gender in the first paragraph. So that&rsquo;s a big difference.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s claim met with quick pushback. Journalist Glenn Greenwald <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/03/03/msnbc-yet-again-broadcasts-blatant-lies-this-time-about-bernie-sanders-opening-speech-and-refuses-to-correct-them/\">noted</a> that Sanders had been introduced by a series of speakers that included three African-Americans (among them was Greenwald&rsquo;s colleague at the Intercept, Shaun King), each of whom highlighted the senator&rsquo;s record as a champion of racial justice.</p>\n\n<p>Responding to criticism on Twitter, Maxwell walked back her initial claim. (She later deleted the erroneous initial tweet.)</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ok. I&rsquo;ve rewatched since yesterday and while I can acknowledge that I missed the passing line at 6 minutes I stand by my point since talking about criminal justice is not the same thing as talking about race and gender and if you don&rsquo;t get why Bernie won&rsquo;t win....again. âœŒðŸ¾&quot; she tweeted.</p>\n\n<p>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</p>\n\n<p>In an interview with PolitiFact, Maxwell acknowledged the error, but stood by her broader point that Sanders had not adequately addressed the issues in his kickoff speech.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Sanders delivered another campaign speech March 3 that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/bernie-sanders-focuses-on-race-in-chicago-rally\">addressed race</a> in more explicit terms. After commemorating the 54th anniversary of Bloody Sunday in Selma, Ala., Sanders delivered a speech in Chicago that called to &quot;end the institutional racism which permeates almost every aspect of our society.&quot;</p>\n\n<div class=\"pf_subheadline\">Our ruling</div>\n\n<p>Maxwell said, Sanders &quot;did not mention race or gender until 23 minutes into this speech&quot; announcing his 2020 presidential run.</p>\n\n<p>Sanders made reference to race and gender within the first five minutes of his speech. Maxwell has since acknowledged that she overlooked this, and deleted an erroneous tweet.</p>\n\n<p>We rate this False.</p>",
